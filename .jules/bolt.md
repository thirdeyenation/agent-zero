## 2023-10-27 - Early returns on template substitution
**Learning:** Found that `replace_placeholders_text` and `replace_placeholders_json` do expensive string manipulations even when no placeholders exist in the text. Checking `if "{{" not in _content:` provides an extremely fast fast-path early return.
**Action:** Always add early-exit checks for common trigger substrings (like `{{` for templates) before iterating over large variable dictionaries to perform string replacement.
