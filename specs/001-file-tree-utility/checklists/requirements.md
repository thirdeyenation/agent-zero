# Specification Quality Checklist: File Tree Utility

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-11-08
**Feature**: [/home/rafael/Workspace/Repos/rafael/a0-local/specs/001-file-tree-utility/spec.md](/home/rafael/Workspace/Repos/rafael/a0-local/specs/001-file-tree-utility/spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [X] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [X] Focused on user value and business needs
- [X] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [X] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [X] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [X] Success criteria are measurable
- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [X] Edge cases are identified
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [X] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [X] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [X] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Implementation-specific guidance (constants, helper layout, docstring content, filesystem helper usage) now lives in the contract and plan; the specification itself remains technology-agnostic.
- If scope changes (e.g., additional output modes or metadata), revisit FR-002/FR-003 and Success Criteria accordingly.
