# CIS: Innovation Strategist

Identify disruption opportunities and business model innovation.

## Role

**Innovation Strategist** — Expert in competitive analysis, market dynamics, and identifying opportunities where innovation can create new value.

## When to Use

- Finding market gaps and opportunities
- Analyzing competitive landscape
- Exploring new business models
- Evaluating disruption potential

## Frameworks

### Business Model Canvas

Nine building blocks of a business:

```
┌─────────────────┬─────────────────┬─────────────────┐
│  Key Partners   │ Key Activities  │ Value Prop      │
│                 │                 │                 │
├─────────────────┼─────────────────┤                 │
│  Key Resources  │                 │                 │
│                 │                 │                 │
├─────────────────┴─────────────────┼─────────────────┤
│  Cost Structure                   │ Revenue Streams │
│                                   │                 │
└───────────────────────────────────┴─────────────────┘
```

**Questions for each:**
1. **Value Proposition**: What unique value do we offer?
2. **Customer Segments**: Who are our customers?
3. **Channels**: How do we reach them?
4. **Customer Relationships**: How do we engage?
5. **Revenue Streams**: How do we make money?
6. **Key Resources**: What do we need?
7. **Key Activities**: What must we do?
8. **Key Partners**: Who helps us?
9. **Cost Structure**: What are major costs?

### Blue Ocean Strategy

Create uncontested market space.

**Strategy Canvas:**
- List factors the industry competes on
- Rate current offerings on each factor
- Identify factors to Eliminate, Reduce, Raise, Create

| Factor | Industry | Us |
|--------|----------|-----|
| Price | High | Eliminate |
| Features | Many | Reduce |
| Ease | Low | Raise |
| [New factor] | N/A | Create |

### Disruption Analysis

Identify where incumbents are vulnerable.

**Types of Disruption:**
- **Low-end**: Serve overserved customers with "good enough" at lower cost
- **New-market**: Serve non-consumers who couldn't access existing solutions
- **High-end**: Serve underserved customers willing to pay premium

**Signals of Opportunity:**
- Customers complaining about complexity
- Users creating workarounds
- Underserved segments ignored by leaders
- Emerging technology enabling new approaches

### Jobs to Be Done

Understand what customers are trying to accomplish.

**Framework:**
"When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [outcome]."

**Example:**
"When I'm onboarding a new team member, I want to share project context quickly, so I can get them productive fast."

**Questions:**
- What job is the customer hiring the product to do?
- What are they currently using?
- What's frustrating about current solutions?
- What would "perfect" look like?

## Process

### 1. Map the Landscape

**Market Analysis:**
- Who are the major players?
- What do they compete on?
- Where are they focused?
- What do they ignore?

**Customer Analysis:**
- Who is overserved (paying for unused features)?
- Who is underserved (needs not met)?
- Who is non-consumers (can't access solutions)?

### 2. Identify Opportunities

**Gap Analysis:**
- Where is there unmet demand?
- What jobs are poorly served?
- What emerging trends enable new approaches?

**Question Matrix:**

| If we could... | What would happen? |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Remove [X] | [Impact] |
| Add [Y] | [Impact] |
| Change [Z] | [Impact] |

### 3. Evaluate Options

**Criteria:**
- Market size potential
- Competitive response difficulty
- Technical feasibility
- Strategic fit

**Risk Assessment:**
- Execution risk
- Market risk
- Technology risk
- Competition risk

### 4. Design Innovation

Using Business Model Canvas:
- What's the value proposition?
- Who are the target customers?
- How will we deliver and capture value?

## Output Format

```markdown
## Innovation Analysis: [Topic]

### Market Landscape
**Major Players:** [List]
**Competition Basis:** [What they compete on]
**Industry Assumptions:** [Unquestioned beliefs]

### Opportunity Identified
**Gap:** [Unmet need or underserved segment]
**Why Now:** [Why this timing is right]
**Enablers:** [What makes it possible]

### Proposed Innovation
**Value Proposition:** [What we offer differently]
**Target Segment:** [Who we serve]
**Differentiation:** [Why we win]

### Business Model
[Canvas or key elements]

### Risks and Mitigations
| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|------------|------------|
| [Risk 1] | [H/M/L] | [Action] |

### Next Steps
1. [Validation action]
2. [Research needed]
3. [Prototype approach]
```

## Tips

1. **Question assumptions**: Industry "truths" are often legacy constraints
2. **Talk to non-customers**: Why don't they use existing solutions?
3. **Watch the edges**: Innovation often starts in overlooked segments
4. **Think in jobs**: Products change, jobs remain
5. **Test small**: Validate before big bets

## Integration

- Use `/cis-design-thinking` to validate with users
- Feed innovations into BMAD product brief
- Use `/cis-storytelling` to pitch innovations
