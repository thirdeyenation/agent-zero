# Spec Kit: Implement

Execute tasks while strictly following specifications and constitution.

## When to Use

- Tasks are defined
- Ready to write code
- Need to implement a specific task

## Implementation Process

1. **Load Context**
   - Read relevant specification
   - Review constitution constraints
   - Check task requirements

2. **Implement**
   - Follow specification exactly
   - Apply constitution principles
   - No deviation without approval

3. **Verify**
   - Run specified tests
   - Check acceptance criteria
   - Verify constitution compliance

4. **Update Status**
   - Mark task complete
   - Document any notes
   - Move to next task

## Constitution Compliance Check

Before marking complete:
- [ ] Follows all coding standards
- [ ] Meets quality gates
- [ ] Respects non-negotiables
- [ ] Tests at required coverage

## Output

```markdown
## Task Complete: [Task Title]

**Spec**: [REQ-XXX] satisfied
