# AMPLIHACK: Analyze

Perform deep analysis of code, requirements, or systems.

## When to Use

- Need to understand existing code
- Analyzing requirements for implementation
- Investigating issues or bugs
- Understanding system architecture

## Analysis Modes

### TRIAGE (Rapid Scanning)
- Quick overview
- Identify key components
- Surface-level understanding

### DEEP (Thorough Investigation)
- Detailed code examination
- Trace execution paths
- Map dependencies

### SYNTHESIS (Multi-source Integration)
- Combine multiple analyses
- Cross-reference findings
- Build complete picture

## Analysis Process

1. **Determine Mode**: Based on task complexity
2. **Gather Sources**: Files, docs, code
3. **Execute Analysis**: Per selected mode
4. **Document Findings**: Structured report

## Output Format

```markdown
## Analysis Report: [Subject]
