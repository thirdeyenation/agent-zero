# Self Update

Agent Zero includes a Docker-oriented self-update flow for switching to a specific repository version tag on `main`, `testing`, or `development`.

## How it works

1. The WebUI writes a YAML request file outside `/a0` so the request survives upgrades and downgrades.
2. Agent Zero restarts.
3. The durable updater in `/exe` reads the YAML request before starting the UI.
4. If requested, it creates a zip backup of `/a0/usr`.
5. It fetches the requested branch and version tag from the official Agent Zero repository.
6. It updates `/a0` while preserving gitignored paths such as `/a0/usr`.
7. It starts Agent Zero again and waits for `/api/health` to become healthy.
8. If the UI does not become healthy within the allowed time, it restores the previous checkout and starts that version again.

## Durable files

The self-update flow stores its runtime files outside `/a0`:

- Trigger file: `/exe/a0-self-update.yaml`
- Status file: `/exe/a0-self-update-status.yaml`
- Last attempt log: `/exe/a0-self-update.log`

Because these files live in `/exe`, you can recover from an older downgraded `/a0` by creating a new update YAML manually.

## Backup behavior

The updater can create a zip backup of `/a0/usr` before replacing repository files.

- The default backup directory is `/a0/tmp/self-update-backups`
- The default file name format is `usr-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.zip`
- Conflict handling supports rename, overwrite, or fail-before-restart

## Version selection

The WebUI fetches repository version tags for the selected branch and lets you enter any exact version manually, including downgrades.

Agent Zero version tags follow this format:

`v{epoch}.{major}.{minor}.{rest}`

Examples:

- `v0.9.9.2`
- `v1.0.3.0`

## Major version limitation

Self-update is intentionally limited to changes within the same `epoch.major` line.

If the requested version changes the `epoch` or `major` part of the version, the UI blocks the update and shows a warning. Those upgrades require downloading a new Docker image because they can include operating system level changes or other breaking changes outside the repository checkout.

## Safety notes

- Gitignored paths are preserved during update
- Obsolete tracked files are removed as part of the checkout replacement
- Rollback is automatic when the updated UI fails its health check
- The updater itself lives outside `/a0`, so it is not lost by downgrading to an older repository state
